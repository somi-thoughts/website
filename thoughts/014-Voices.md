Somi,

I can't deal with the amount of voices here. Three different conversations going on around me and I can't leave. I am not engaging with any of them. Somehow every second the voices feel louder and louder. I can't think or daydream without getting snapped out of it by the sound of someone laughing. Most days I can tolerate this. Why is it so hard today? Please no.. that group splitting up their conversation.. FFF now it is 4 conversation group. I rarely am stuck somewhere with many people talking where I can't just get away or put my headphones on. I already left halfway two times before I can't afford to do that again. Is this how autists feel every day? 

I thought the ear pain was just mental, but hours later and my ears still hurt from that grueling hour. Only positive note was the view, seeing the unclimbable hills and arches in that state was magnification. As my mind was going in overdrive from the noise, I could for a few moments become fixated on the movements of those small hills allowing me to see delayed movements making me believe in relativity. Unfortunately the tunnelvision didn't last, now I need a break to recover from the break. Save me Somi.
